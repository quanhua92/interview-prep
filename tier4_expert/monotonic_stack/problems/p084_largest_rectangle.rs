/*
 * P84: Largest Rectangle in Histogram (Hard)
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/
 * Topics: Array, Stack, Monotonic Stack
 *
 * Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *     Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
 *     Output: 10
 *     Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
 *     The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *     Input: heights = [2,4]
 *     Output: 4
 *
 * Constraints:
 *     - 1 <= heights.length <= 105
 *     - 0 <= heights[i] <= 104
 *
 * Template (python3):
 *     class Solution:
 *         def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
 *
 * Hint: Use a monotonic increasing stack with a sentinel to compute max rectangle area.
