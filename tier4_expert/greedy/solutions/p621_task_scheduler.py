P621: Task Scheduler (Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/
Topics: Array, Hash Table, Greedy, Sorting, Heap, Counting

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number n.
Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with the same label.
Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.

Example 1:
    Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
    Output: 8
    Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
    After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle.

Example 2:
    Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
    Output: 6
    Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

Example 3:
    Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
    Output: 10
    Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

Constraints:
    - 1 <= tasks.length <= 104
    - tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
    - 0 <= n <= 100

Template (python3):
    class Solution:
        def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:

Hint: The idle slots are determined by the most frequent task. Formula: max((maxFreq - 1) * (n + 1) + countMaxFreq, len(tasks)).
