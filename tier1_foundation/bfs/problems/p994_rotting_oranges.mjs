/**
 * P994: Rotting Oranges (Medium)
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/
 * Topics: Array, Breadth-First Search, Matrix
 *
 * You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
 * Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
 * Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *     Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
 *     Output: 4
 *
 * Example 2:
 *     Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
 *     Output: -1
 *
 * Example 3:
 *     Input: grid = [[0,2]]
 *     Output: 0
 *
 * Hint: Use BFS starting from all rotten oranges simultaneously.
