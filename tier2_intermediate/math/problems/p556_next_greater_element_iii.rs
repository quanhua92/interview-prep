/*
 * P556: Next Greater Element III [PREMIUM] (Medium)
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-iii/
 * Topics: Math, Two Pointers, String
 *
 * Given a positive integer n, find the smallest integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer n and is greater in value than n. If no such positive integer exists, return -1.
 * Note that the returned integer should fit in 32-bit integer, if there is a valid answer but it does not fit in 32-bit integer, return -1.
 * Example 1:
 *     Input: n = 12
 *     Output: 21
 *
 * Example 2:
 *     Input: n = 21
 *     Output: -1
 *
 * Constraints:
 *     - 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
 *
 * Template (python3):
 *     class Solution:
 *         def nextGreaterElement(self, n: int) -> int:
