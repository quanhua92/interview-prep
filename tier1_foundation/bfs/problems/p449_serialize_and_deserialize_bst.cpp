/*
 * P449: Serialize and Deserialize BST [PREMIUM] (Medium)
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-bst/
 * Topics: String, Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Design, Binary Search Tree, Binary Tree
 *
 * Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 * The encoded string should be as compact as possible.
 * Example 1:
 *     Input: root = [2,1,3]
 *     Output: [2,1,3]
 *
 * Example 2:
 *     Input: root = []
 *     Output: []
 *
 * Constraints:
 *     - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
 *     - 0 <= Node.val <= 10^4
 *     - The input tree is guaranteed to be a binary search tree.
 *
 * Template (python3):
 *     # Definition for a binary tree node.
 *     # class TreeNode:
 *     #     def __init__(self, x):
 *     #         self.val = x
 *     #         self.left = None
 *     #         self.right = None
 *
 *     class Codec:
 *
 *         def serialize(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
 *             '''Encodes a tree to a single string.
 *             '''
 *
 *
 *         def deserialize(self, data: str) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
 *             '''Decodes your encoded data to tree.
 *             '''
 *
 *     # Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
 *     # Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
 *     # ser = Codec()
 *     # deser = Codec()
 *     # tree = ser.serialize(root)
 *     # ans = deser.deserialize(tree)
 *     # return ans
