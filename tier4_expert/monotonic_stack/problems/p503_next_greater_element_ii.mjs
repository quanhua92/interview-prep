/**
 * P503: Next Greater Element II [PREMIUM] (Medium)
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/
 * Topics: Array, Stack, Monotonic Stack
 *
 * Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.
 * The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.
 * Example 1:
 *     Input: nums = [1,2,1]
 *     Output: [2,-1,2]
 *
 * Example 2:
 *     Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
 *     Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
 *
 * Constraints:
 *     - 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 *     - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
