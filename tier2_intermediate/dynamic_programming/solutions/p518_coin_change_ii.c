 * P518: Coin Change II [PREMIUM] (Medium)
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/
 * Topics: Array, Dynamic Programming
 *
 * You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
 * Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.
 * You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
 * The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.
 * Example 1:
 *     Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
 *     Output: 4
 *     Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
 *     5=5
 *     5=2+2+1
 *     5=2+1+1+1
 *     5=1+1+1+1+1
 *
 * Example 2:
 *     Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
 *     Output: 0
 *     Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *     Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
 *     Output: 1
 *
 * Constraints:
 *     - 1 <= coins.length <= 300
 *     - 1 <= coins[i] <= 5000
 *     - All the values of coins are unique.
 *     - 0 <= amount <= 5000
 *
 * Template (python3):
 *     class Solution:
 *         def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
