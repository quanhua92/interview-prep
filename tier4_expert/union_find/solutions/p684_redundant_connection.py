P684: Redundant Connection (Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/
Topics: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Union Find, Graph

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.
Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

Example 1:
    Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
    Output: [2,3]

Example 2:
    Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
    Output: [1,4]

Constraints:
    - n == edges.length
    - 3 <= n <= 1000
    - edges[i].length == 2
    - 1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
    - ai != bi
    - There are no repeated edges.
    - The given graph is connected.

Template (python3):
    class Solution:
        def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:

Hint: Use Union-Find to detect the first edge that connects two already-connected nodes.
